### Proposed Solution

Idea – To develop an AI based bond credit rating system
We propose an AI based credit rating system which would use company financials, past track record and present financial health to determine bond credit ratings.
The system will work as follows – 

    1.	Analyse company 10Q and 10K financial reports to predict its current financial health.

    2.	Analyse the past track record of the company to predict the future trends.

    3.	Sum up the current financial health and the predicted future trend in a 10-point scale credit rating.

    4.	Plot the risk of prediction inaccuracy and uncertainty in the form of a risk timeline into the future.

    5.	Track the ongoing financial events, economic swings and the business environment and 

    6.	update in real time the current bond credit rating and the risk timeline.

    7.	Publish the ratings and the risk timeline on a free and open to public live website along with a full-fledged report of the analysis and assumptions behind the credit rating of a company and the corresponding risk timeline.

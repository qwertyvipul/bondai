### Current Problem
In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the credit rating agencies have often been criticised and their principles questioned from investigators, economists, and journalists. There have been several accusations on the legitimacy of these agencies, some of which are –

    1.	Competitive pressure to lower standards – The current system of credit rating involves issuers paying these agencies fees to rate their bonds. In the attempt to attract more issuers and reduce peer pressure these agencies are accused of lowering their standards to obtain heightened profits.

    2.	Conflict of interest – Often rating agencies are one of the bodies that advice and help issuers in procuring loans in return of fees. Then after issuer reaches back to these agencies to get their bonds rated which raises a very serious question – Why would an agency downrate a bond which it helped create in the first place?

    3.	Emotional Bias – Often rating agencies have been viewed as aligned towards certain types of issuers and taking the advantage of which the issuers approach to the agencies aligned towards them to get better credit ratings.

    4.	Unwillingness to spend on Human Resource – Since the rating agencies often work on a commission basis, they are reluctant to spend on human resource in order to squeeze out the maximum profits from the credit rating business.

All these factors have often been claimed to have had a major role in the 2007-2010 financial crisis. Also, such accusations increase the market risk for individual investors who often do not have enough resources to conduct independent research on these debt instruments. The big players of the financial world end up exploiting the investors obligations due to lack of resources and the profit-making mindset of the rating agencies in their favours.

These not only leads to financial discrimination of the investors but also puts them at risk of huge financial losses and many end up losing their life long savings.
